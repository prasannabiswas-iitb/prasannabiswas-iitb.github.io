		<h2 id="bio">About me</h2></div>
    I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Qualcomm, Bangalore. I work on on ONNX optimizations for NLP (Natural Language Processing), CV (Computer Vision), and LLMs for faster inference on Qualcomm's AI100 accelerator. I design and implement software modules for Artificial Intelligence/Deep Neural Network frameworks and tools in C++ & Python. I work on implementing node fusion as a custom operation for the models. Before Qualcomm, I was a a Research assistant at Center for Indian Language Technology, <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology Bombay</a>. I was a part of IBM-AIHN Network wherein I worked on studying the Effect of Sarcasm in Emotion Analysis using a Multi-Modal approach.

        <h2 id="research">My research</h2></div>
        My primary area of interest is <i>Machine Learning for Natural Langauge Processing</i> and I am quite passionate about problems related to language generation, language models, and multimodal and cognition-inspired NLP. While working as a Research Assistant, I developed a multi-modal approach of understanding emotions in a Sarcasm. The work touches upon the incongruities of the language. The hidden emotions behind a sentence. In text-to-text, my focus has been on problems such as emotion classiffication, sentiment analysis and understanding sarcasm. Over the years, I have been quite fascinated by generative modeling for conversational AI and have spent a considerable amount of time working on problems related to computation time and memory requirement of the models. I also worked with graph neural networks for efficient compilation of the ML models.

        <b>Computational Model for Understanding Emotions in Sarcasm</b>
		<ul>
      <br>
			<li><u>Problem Statement: </u></li>
      <li>Sarcasm is a very sophisticated linguistic articulationwhere the sentential meaning is often disbelieved due to the linguistic incongru-encies or differences in implied and surface sentiment. This makes the emotionrecognition task extremely challenging in case of Sarcasm. </li>
      <li>We had two major contributions on this project:</li>
      <li><u>Dataset Contribution:</u></li>
      <li>Previous works have extensively studied sentiment andemotion in language, while the relationship between sarcasm and emotion hasbeen largely unaddressed. To address this we created a benchmark dataset ’emo-UStARD’, of sarcastic and non-sarcastic videos, that is annotated with 8 primaryemotions, and also arousal and valence levels to get the intensity of emotions.</li>
      <li><u>System Contribution:</u></li> 
      <li>Sarcasm is generally associated with a negative emotion. The question is which negative emotion- anger, sadness, disgust, any other?And e-commerce people are more interested in question like “Does the sentence have anger?” or “Does this sentence have disgust?” To address this, we build a One Vs Rest classifier to predict exact emotions present in Sarcastic sentence.</li>
      <li>We also carried out rigorous experimentation using textual modality and provedthe importance of contextual and additional information to predict emotions insarcastic sentence.</li>
      <li> Tried submissions:  <a href = "Sarcasm_EMNLP2020_draft.pdf"> Sarcasm_EMNLP2020_draft </a>, <a href = "Emotion_Sarcasm.pdf"> Sarcasm_NAACL2021_draft </a></li>
		</ul>
		<b>Investigating importance of multiple modalities in Sarcasm Detection</b>
		<ul>
      <br>
      <li><u>Literature Survey</u></li>
      <li>Conducted a literature survey on foundations of Sentiment and Emotion Analysis. Extracting sentiment as a Quintuple from unstructured data. Studied various representations of emotions, emotion lexicons, different approaches in emotion analysis and it’s applications in the real world. Explored open resources available for emoji, emoji interpretation,emoji sense similarity, and their combined applications with deep learning in the field of Emotion Analysis.</li>
      <li><u>Objective:</u></li>
      <li>To analyze the importance of multiple modalities in Sarcasm detection from text. Worked on emojis considering it as one of the modalities. Emojis help us to understand the mood of the user in a better way.</li>
      <li>Implemented a basic LSTM-NN classifier and a fasttextclassifier as a baseline for sarcasm detection problem which had text with emojis. Conducted experiments on these classifiers by placing emojis at different positions in the text for analysing the positional importance of emojis. Analyzed the effectiveness of features from knowledge graphs like SentiWord-net and EmojiNet. The accuracy increased and the values were close to 90%.</li>
      <li>After analysing the results using LIME - An Interpretability tool,it was clear that passing additional information like Emoji do help in better classifying the sentence as Sarcastic or Non-Sarcastic.</li>

		<h2 id="bio">About Me</h2></div>
    I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Qualcomm, Bangalore. I work on ONNX optimizations for NLP, CV, and LLMs (Large Language Models) for faster inference on Qualcomm's AI100 accelerator. I design and implement software modules for Artificial Intelligence/Deep Neural Network frameworks and tools in C++ & Python. I work on implementing node fusion as a custom operation for the models. Before Qualcomm, I was a Research Assistant at the Center for Indian Language Technology, <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology Bombay</a>. I was part of IBM-AIHN Network wherein I worked on studying the effect of sarcasm in emotion analysis using multi-modal approach.

        <h2 id="research">My Research</h2></div>
        My primary area of interest is <i>Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing</i> and I am quite passionate about problems related to language generation, language models, and multimodal NLP. While working as Research Assistant, I developed a multi-modal approach to understanding emotions in Sarcasm. The work touches upon the incongruities of the language. The hidden emotions behind a sentence. In text-to-text, my focus has been on problems such as emotion classification, sentiment analysis, and understanding sarcasm. Over the years, I have been quite fascinated by generative modeling for conversational AI and have spent a considerable amount of time working on problems related to computational time and memory requirements of the models. I also worked with graph neural networks for efficient compilation of the ML models.

        <b>Computational Model for Understanding Emotions in Sarcasm</b>
		<ul>
      <br>
			<li><u>Problem Statement: </u></li>
      <li>Sarcasm is a very sophisticated linguistic articulation where the sentential meaning is often disbelieved due to the linguistic incongruencies or differences in implied and surface sentiment. This makes the emotion recognition task extremely challenging in case of sarcasm. </li>
      <li>We had two major contributions on this project:</li>
      <li><u>Dataset Contribution:</u></li>
      <li>Previous works have extensively studied sentiment and emotion in language, while the relationship between sarcasm and emotion has been largely unaddressed. To address this, we created a benchmark dataset 'emo-UStARD', of sarcastic and non-sarcastic videos, that is annotated with 8 primary emotions, and also arousal - valence levels to get the intensity of emotions.</li>
      <li><u>System Contribution:</u></li> 
      <li>Sarcasm is generally associated with negative emotion. The question is which negative emotion - anger, sadness, disgust, any other? And e-commerce people are more interested in questions like “Does this sentence have anger?” or “Does this sentence have disgust?” To address this, we built a "One v/s Rest" classifier to predict exact emotions present in an sarcastic sentence.</li>
      <li>We also carried out rigorous experimentation using textual modality and proved the importance of contextual and additional information to predict emotions in sarcastic sentence.</li>
      <li> Tried submissions:  <a href = "Sarcasm_EMNLP2020_draft.pdf"> Sarcasm_EMNLP2020_draft </a>, <a href = "Emotion_Sarcasm.pdf"> Sarcasm_NAACL2021_draft </a></li>
		</ul>
		<b>Investigating Importance of Multiple Modalities in Sarcasm Detection</b>
		<ul>
      <br>
      <li><u>Literature Survey</u></li>
      <li>Conducted literature survey on foundations of sentiment and emotion analysis. Extracting sentiment as a quintuple from unstructured data. Studied various representations of emotions, emotion lexicons, different approaches in emotion analysis and it's applications in the real world. Explored open resources available for emoji, emoji interpretation, emoji sense similarity, and their combined applications with deep learning.</li>
      <li><u>Objective:</u></li>
      <li>To analyze the importance of multiple modalities in sarcasm detection from text. Worked on emojis considering it as one of the modalities. Emojis help us to understand the mood of the user in a better way.</li>
      <li>Implemented LSTM-NN and fasttext classifier as a baseline for sarcasm detection problem which had text with emojis. Conducted experiments on these classifiers by placing emojis at different positions in the text for analysing the positional importance of emojis. Analyzed the effectiveness of features from knowledge graphs like SentiWord-Net and EmojiNet. The accuracy increased and the values were close to 90%.</li>
      <li>After analysing the results using LIME - An Interpretability Tool, it was clear that passing additional information like emoji do help in better classifying the sentence as sarcastic or non-sarcastic.</li>
